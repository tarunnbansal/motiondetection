# Motion Detection using OpenCV and Python

I created this simple project in OpenCV Python which uses webcam/external webcam to capture video.

The first frame is saved as a reference and rest all frames are compared to detect the motion. 

I used two different cameras for the project ( RGB and Intel Depth Sense)
