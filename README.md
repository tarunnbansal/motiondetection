# Motion Detection using OpenCV and Python

This project captures video and senses motion in the frame and appends a csv(excel) file with START and END timestamps.

I created this simple project in OpenCV Python which uses webcam/external webcam to capture video.
The first frame is saved as a reference and rest all frames are compared to detect the motion. 
I used two different cameras for the project ( RGB and Intel Depth Sense)
